Import data into R
  
List of all features
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
  feat <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns

Links the class labels with their activity name
Activities the participants were performing when features X were recorded
  act <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns

Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
  subject_test <- subject_test.txt 2947 : rows, 1 column
  
Test set of data
  X_test <- X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
  y_test <- y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns

Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
  subject_train <- subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column

Training set of data
  X_train <- X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
  y_train <- y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns


Merge training and test sets using rbind
  X_comb : 10299 rows, 561 columns
  y_comb : 10299 rows, 1 column
  subject_comb : 10299 rows, 1 column

Combining into one table using cbind
  mergedData : 10299 rows, 563 column

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
Subset of mergedData using only subj, cd, and feat which contain the words "mean" or "std"
  tidy : 10299 rows, 88 columns 
  
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  tidy$cd <- act[tidy$cd, 2] 

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  cd column in tidy renamed into activity
  Acc in column names' replaced by Accelerometer
  Gyro in column names' replaced by Gyroscope
  BodyBody in column names' replaced by Body
  Features starting with "f" in column names' replaced by Frequency
  Features starting with "t" in column names' replaced by Time

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
Take mean of each variable and activity and put into new table
  tidySummary : 180 rows, 88 columns 
  
Export into Summary.txt
